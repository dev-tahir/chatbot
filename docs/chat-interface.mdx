# Chat Interface

The chat interface is the main component of the application, providing real-time communication capabilities.

## Features

- Real-time message updates
- Message history
- Typing indicators
- Message status (sent, delivered, read)
- File attachments support
- Responsive design

## Usage

The chat interface is implemented in `app/components/ChatInterface.tsx`. To use it in your own component:

```tsx
import ChatInterface from '@/components/ChatInterface';

export default function YourComponent() {
  return (
    <ChatInterface 
      // Add your props here
    />
  );
}
```

## SDK Integration

You can also interact with the chat backend programmatically using the provided SDK.

For example, to send a message and receive an AI response:

```typescript
import { KiloCodeSDK } from '../sdk';

const sdk = new KiloCodeSDK('http://localhost:3000');

async function sendMessage() {
  const response = await sdk.chat.sendMessage("Hello, AI!");
  if (response) {
    console.log("AI Response:", response.response);
  } else {
    console.error("Failed to get AI response.");
  }
}

sendMessage();
```

> Make sure the `sdk` directory is added to your project and the API base URL matches your deployment.

## Customization

The chat interface can be customized through props and CSS styling. See the component documentation for available options.
