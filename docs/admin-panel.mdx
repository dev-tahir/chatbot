# Admin Panel

The **Admin Panel** provides an interface for administrators to manage users and configure general settings for your Chatbot application.

---

## Overview

The admin panel is accessible to authenticated admin users and consists of two main sections, accessible via tabs:

- **User Dashboard**
- **Settings**

---

## User Dashboard

This tab allows you to manage and monitor registered users in your application.

**Features:**

- View a list of all users with details such as ID, name, and email.
- (Depending on implementation, you may see functionality to edit user roles, remove users, or view user activity.)

**Navigation:**

When you open the Admin Panel, you land on the **User Dashboard** tab by default.

---

## Settings

The **Settings** tab lets you configure general settings for the administration and operation of your site.

**General Settings Include:**

- **Site Title:** Set the display title for your website.
- **Admin Email:** Configure the primary admin contact email.
- **Items Per Page (Dashboard):** Set how many users are listed per page on the dashboard.

Changes can be saved by clicking **Save Settings**.

## Navigating Between Tabs

At the top of the Admin Panel, you'll find navigation tabs:

- Click **User Dashboard** to view and manage users.
- Click **Settings** to update general site and admin information.

The active tab is highlighted for ease of use.
