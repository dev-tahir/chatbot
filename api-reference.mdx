# API Reference

## Blog Posts API

The Blog Posts API allows you to fetch a list of blog posts, including their title, content, and author information. Below is an overview of how this API is used in the application.

### Endpoint

```
GET /api/blog
```

### Description

Fetches all blog posts. The result is an array of post objects, each containing the following fields:

- `id` (string): Unique identifier for the post.
- `title` (string): The title of the blog post.
- `content` (string | null): The main content of the post.
- `author` (object):
  - `name` (string | null): Name of the author.

### Example Request

```ts
const res = await fetch(`${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL}/api/blog`, {
  cache: 'no-store', // Ensure data is always fresh
});
const posts = await res.json();
```

### Example Response

```json
[
  {
    "id": "abc123",
    "title": "Welcome to the blog!",
    "content": "This is our first post.",
    "author": {
      "name": "Alice"
    }
  },
  {
    "id": "def456",
    "title": "Second Post",
    "content": "Another interesting update.",
    "author": {
      "name": "Bob"
    }
  }
]
```

### Error Handling

If the API returns an error (e.g., network failure or non-2xx status), the application displays an error message:

```tsx
{error && (
  <div>
    <strong>Error:</strong> {error}
  </div>
)}
```

### UI Integration

The posts are displayed in a responsive grid. Each post shows its title, content, and the author's name. If there are no posts, the message "No posts found." is displayed.
